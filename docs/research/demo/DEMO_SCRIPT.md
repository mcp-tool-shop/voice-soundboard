# Voice Studio v1.2 - Demo Script

## Video Title
**"The Science of Natural Voice: Voice Studio Demo"**

## Duration
~3 minutes

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Screen: Voice Studio logo animation]**

**NARRATOR (warm, confident):**
> "What if AI voices could sound truly human? Not just clear and accurate, but naturally expressive - with the subtle imperfections that make human speech feel alive."

**[Screen: Quick montage of Voice Studio UI]**

> "Introducing Voice Studio v1.2 - where voice science meets AI synthesis."

---

## SECTION 1: The Problem (0:20 - 0:45)

**[Screen: Side-by-side comparison - "Robotic" vs "Natural"]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Traditional text-to-speech sounds mechanical because it's too perfect. Real human voices have subtle variations - micro-fluctuations in pitch, natural timing shifts, the way we slide into notes."

**[Play Audio Sample: ROBOTIC version]**
> Sample text: "Hello! Welcome to Voice Studio. I'm excited to show you what's possible."

**NARRATOR:**
> "Hear how flat that sounds? Now listen to the same text with vocology applied..."

**[Play Audio Sample: NATURAL version with vocology]**

> "The difference is in the science."

---

## SECTION 2: Vocology Features (0:45 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Voice Studio UI - Vocology section expanded]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Voice Studio's Vocology section brings voice science to your fingertips."

### Emotional States Demo (0:50 - 1:10)

**[Screen: Click through emotion chips while audio plays]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Choose an emotional state, and the voice transforms."

**[Play samples for each emotion:]**
- **Neutral**: "The meeting starts at three o'clock."
- **Excited**: "The meeting starts at three o'clock!"
- **Confident**: "The meeting starts at three o'clock."
- **Tired**: "The meeting starts at three o'clock..."
- **Intimate**: "The meeting starts at three o'clock."

### Pitch Controls Demo (1:10 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Adjust Pitch Scooping slider]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Fine-tune pitch scooping - how the voice naturally slides into notes. Or adjust phrase endings for declarative statements versus questions."

**[Play comparison:]**
- Statement: "You're coming to the party." (drop)
- Question: "You're coming to the party?" (rise)

## SECTION 3: Research Lab (1:30 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Research Lab section with EXPERT badge]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "For power users, the Research Lab unlocks acoustic parameters straight from voice research."

### The 1.6-Second Rhythm (1:35 - 1:55)

**[Screen: Highlight the Rhythm Unit slider at 1.6s]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Here's something fascinating: in 2024, neuroscientists discovered that humans universally chunk speech into 1.6-second phrases. This timing appears across every language and culture on Earth."

**[Screen: Adjust rhythm slider, play samples]**

> "Voice Studio lets you tap into this natural rhythm."

### Phonation Types (1:55 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Click through phonation chips]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "And with phonation controls, switch between modal, breathy, creaky, or harsh voice qualities - each one scientifically defined."

**[Play samples of each phonation type]**

---

## SECTION 4: Real-Time Preview (2:15 - 2:40)

**[Screen: Type text, adjust sliders, click Generate Preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Everything updates in real-time. Type your text, adjust parameters, and hear the results instantly."

**[Screen: Show waveform visualization, click to seek]**

> "Click anywhere on the waveform to seek. Export as WAV, MP3, or OGG."

**[Screen: Show Save Preset modal]**

> "Save your custom voice presets to use again and again."

---

## SECTION 5: Integration (2:40 - 2:55)

**[Screen: Code snippet / MCP tools]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Voice Studio works as an MCP server - integrate it with Claude, build it into your applications, or use it standalone."

```python
# MCP tool call example
studio_start()
studio_ai_describe("warm narrator voice")
studio_preview()
```

---

## OUTRO (2:55 - 3:10)

**[Screen: Voice Studio logo + GitHub link]**

**NARRATOR (warm, inviting):**
> "Voice Studio v1.2 - where voice science creates naturally human AI speech."

> "Try it free on GitHub."

**[Screen: github.com/mcp-tool-shop/voice-soundboard]**

> "Because the best AI voice... is one that sounds human."

**[End card with social links]**

## Music Notes

- Background music: Soft, techy ambient (think Tycho, Bonobo)
- Fade music under during audio sample playback
- Keep music minimal to let voice samples shine
