# Start Here

New to Voice Soundboard? This page tells you what to read and what to skip.

---

## Read This First

1. **[README](../README.md)** -- install, quick start, what this project does
2. **[examples/hello_world.py](../examples/hello_world.py)** -- the one canonical example
3. **[GLOSSARY](GLOSSARY.md)** -- what every term means (one page)

## Read When You Need It

| Topic | Where | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| All Python examples | [`examples/`](../examples/) | When you want to try a specific feature |
| MCP server setup | [README > MCP Server](../README.md#mcp-server-for-ai-agents) | When connecting to Claude Desktop |
| Voice list | `engine.list_voices()` or [config.py](../voice_soundboard/config.py) | When picking a voice |
| Security details | [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](../SECURITY_AUDIT.md) | When deploying to production |
| Contributing | [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | When submitting a PR |

## Ignore For Now

These are **research** and **experimental** docs. They exist for contributors and researchers, not for getting started.

| Folder | Status | What's In It |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `docs/research/vocology/` | Research | Voice science papers, formant analysis, rhythm metrics |
| `docs/research/voice-studio-roadmap.md` | Experimental | Future plans for voice preset editing |
| `docs/research/demo/` | Experimental | Demo scripts for conference presentations |

You will never need these unless you're contributing to the vocology module or doing voice science research.
